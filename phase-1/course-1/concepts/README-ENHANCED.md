# Course 1: Introduction to AI and GenAI â€” What / Why / How (with huge humour)

Welcome to the enhanced, highly caffeinated version of Course 1 concepts.

What
- What is this course about? In the simplest terms: machines doing clever-ish things so humans can nap occasionally. We cover core AI ideas, generative AI basics, and the mental gymnastics you need to sound smart at meetups.

Why
- Why learn this? Because understanding "what AI actually does" means you can design systems, ask better questions, and avoid the most embarrassing meetings where everyone says "Let's just put it on AI." (Hint: you probably don't.)

How
- How will we learn? Read a little, run tiny examples in Colab, and build confidence by breaking stuff safely.

Colab starter
- See `../labs/course1_colab_examples.ipynb` for a tiny Google Colab notebook that gets you started (Python basics, printing, and a comic introduction to arrays).

Tiny checklist
- Try the Colab cells, tweak numbers, and laugh at the output.

Humour note
- Expect puns, gentle sarcasm, and metaphors involving coffee and rubber ducks. Learning is better when you're smiling.
