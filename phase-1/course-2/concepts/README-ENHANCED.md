# Course 2: Machine Learning Basics â€” What / Why / How (with enthusiastic metaphors)

What
- Supervised and unsupervised learning, feature engineering, evaluation metrics, and a tiny introduction to model selection. Think of it as teaching a dog to sit, then asking it to fetch a spreadsheet.

Why
- So you can build, evaluate and explain models that actually solve business problems (rather than magic tricks). You'll reduce surprises in production, and increase the number of people impressed by your charts.

How
- Theory + short notebooks in Colab that walk from synthetic data to a trained model in under 10 minutes.

Colab examples
- See `../labs/course2_colab_examples.ipynb` for a hands-on linear regression example using scikit-learn and visualizations.

Humour note
- If your model achieves 100% accuracy, you're either a genius or your dataset leaked the answers. Assume the latter and celebrate cautiously.
