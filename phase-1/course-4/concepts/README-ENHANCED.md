# Course 4: Deep Learning Essentials â€” What / Why / How (with gleeful over-enthusiasm)

What
- Convolutional networks, recurrent structures, LSTMs, optimization tricks, transfer learning, and practical training practices. We'll build intuition and get our hands dirty with TensorFlow/Keras examples.

Why
- Deep learning powers complex perceptual tasks. This course gives you the practical recipe book and the cautionary tales so you can build real systems without accidentally inventing a new set of bugs.

How
- Theory + short Colab notebooks demonstrating a tiny CNN on MNIST, a quick RNN for synthetic time series, and a transfer learning snippet.

Colab examples
- See `../labs/course4_colab_examples.ipynb` for runnable Keras examples adapted for Colab GPU if available.

Humour note
- Deep learning loves big datasets and hates your lunch breaks. Feed it decent data or expect passive-aggressive losses.
